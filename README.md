This is a report on my recent experience in writing a medium-size
vue.js app, for obvious reasons in typescript. To organize the
business logic I used the typedi dependency injection library, and
found that to be a rather nice combination that I wanted to share with
you. While I definitely want to expose the sausage-making process,
this talk does not assume any previous knowledge of vue or typedi.
